# hubitat-gmcmap

Simple Hubitat Driver to grab CPM, ACPM, and uSv from gmcmap.com for a given counter and pull into Hubitat. 

Could use with a RM rule to trigger notifications should CPM rise above a given threshold. 

Credit to the hubitat community, primarily User12Hubitat, to helping me (with some significant issues) get the code working.
